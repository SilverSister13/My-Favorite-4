        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time, such as the wars of Rome or famous people. Whenever I get home from school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and am now in 6th grade. I know well that reading is good, but I have a bad habit of reading too much onece I get into a book, which can be a problem. This is hobby can be developed by anyone, however, this is something i've liked doing since the beginning. Reading books always keeps me always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.
